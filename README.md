### Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm a research scientist and developer.
- ðŸ“– I'm pursuing my PhD at the intersection of continuum mechanics, theoretical modeling (asymptotics and perturbation theory), numerical algorithms, software-at-scale and metamaterial design.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on `SophT`, a HPC library that simulates the dynamics of soft elastic bodies and slender rods, and their interactions with viscous flows.
- ðŸ¥‡ I'm also a contributor to [`PyElastica`](https://www.cosseratrods.org/), an open-source software for the simulation of assemblies of slender, one-dimensional structures using Cosserat Rod theory.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning computational statistics and reinforcement/machine learning.
